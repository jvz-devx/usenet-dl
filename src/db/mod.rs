//! Database layer for usenet-dl
//!
//! Handles SQLite persistence for downloads, articles, passwords, and history.
//!
//! ## Submodules
//!
//! Methods on [`Database`] are organized by domain:
//! - [`migrations`] — Database lifecycle, schema migrations
//! - [`downloads`] — Download queue CRUD
//! - [`articles`] — Article-level tracking for resume support
//! - [`passwords`] — Password cache for archive extraction
//! - [`duplicates`] — Duplicate detection queries
//! - [`history`] — History management
//! - [`state`] — Runtime state (shutdown tracking, NZB processing, RSS seen)
//! - [`rss`] — RSS feed CRUD
